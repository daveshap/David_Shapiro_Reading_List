# David Shapiro Reading List

Public repo of the most influential books I've read. This is a living document. I will try to sort them by order of importance. I've read most of these. Some are still on my TBR. Just because I read a book does not mean I endorse it. Sometimes I read books to get a broader perspective on how other people think.
